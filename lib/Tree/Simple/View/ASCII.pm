=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Tree::Simple::View subclass which provides simple ASCII formatting for trees.

I had this code lying around, and I figured it was best to put it into here. This is 
an early release of this, and it lacks configuration parameter handling, but that can 
be easily added later when I need it.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<expandAllSimple>

This will draw a fully expanded tree. 

=item B<expandAllComplex>

This currently is aliased to the C<expandAllSimple> since we don't have config handling.

=item B<expandPathSimple (@path)>

This will draw a tree with the given C<@path> expanded. 

=item B<expandPathComplex>

This currently is aliased to the C<expandPathSimple> since we don't have config handling.

=back

=head1 TODO

Config handling, allowing you to customize the drawing. Patches welcome, I just don't 
currently have the time to add it.

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.
