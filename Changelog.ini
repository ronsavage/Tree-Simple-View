!*!*!*! MAJOR UPDATE !*!*!*!
- My orginal vision for Tree::Simple::View was that of
a Proxy/Factory/I-Dont-Know-What-I-Was-Thinking class.
But the idea really wasn't that good, matter of fact
it was pretty bad. So this version marks a major update
to the module, the details of which are below.
- Tree::Simple::View::Base has been removed, its code
has been moved to Tree::Simple::View.
- Tree::Simple::View is no longer a "Proxy" class (not
that it ever really was) for the Tree::Simple::View::*
classes. It now is the abstract base class, taking on
the role that Tree::Simple::View::Base once served.
- Tree::Simple::View::HTML has been updated to reflect
its new base class. (Tree::Simple::View::DHTML is a
subclass of Tree::Simple::View::HTML, so it didn't need
to be changed).
- All documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.
- I have added a bunch of tests while I was at it.

Comments= <<EOT
- added simple accessors for the tree and configurations
to the Base class
- added the 'form_element_formatter' to the DHTML class
which allows for form elements to be added to the tree
outside of the link tag.
- fixed a bug in the DHTML implementation where the DHTML
would not work if you had not set a link_css value. Now
you it does work :)
